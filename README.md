The Kevoree Modeling Framework
==========================

The Kevoree Modeling Framework (KMF) started as a research project to create an alternative to the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) (EMF).
Like EMF, KMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building complex object-oriented applications based on structured data models.
However, while EMF was primarily designed to support design-time models, KMF is specifically designed to support the models@run.time paradigm and targets runtime models.
Runtime models of complex systems usually have high requirements regarding memory usage, runtime performance, and thread safety.
KMF was specifically designed with this requirements in mind. 
 
KMF provides developers a powerful toolset to model, structure, and reason about complex data (during design- and runtime), while still being a 'lightweight' framework trying to introduce as less overhead as possible.
Advanced features like a notion of time, a native per object based versioning concept, distribution support, and easy-to-plug machine learning algorithms make KMF a powerful toolset for structuring, processing, and analyzing data.
