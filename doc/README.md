# Introduction

> What is MWG? 

MWG is the first temporal Many World Graph. In a nutshell, this project defines a graph storage and processing framework that allows to store complex data structures, which are highly connected, and rapidly evolving over time. Finally, this data structure can be seen has infinitly clonable to test various graph modifications in order to find the best one. MWG is core data structure of reasoning engines. MWG is:

> What is a temporal graph?

Graphs allow to organize and structure data in form of a set of nodes and relationships between these nodes. Data in real-life applications is barely static, think of social network graphs, i.e., graphs evolve and change over time. MWG adds time as a first class entity to the graph. Therefore, all nodes, attributes and relationships can change over time.

> To do what?

In short, analyzing data in motion! In many domains data coming from different devices and from various timepoints, has to be aggregated in a coherent view in order to reason and take decisions. Towards such goal MWG includes various machine learning algorithms. Example applications where MWG is useful for: IoT systems, cyber-physical systems like smart Grid, trading prediction, and simulation engines.

> Who are we?

Behind MWG stands a research group working hard to make real-time analytcis of complex systems a reality. MWG is developed in Java, with lots of attention to performance and memory requirements. It us proudly built from scratch without any dependency and can process millions of nodes per second on a single computer.

> How to start?

In this small documentation we provide the essential information for a quick start. Then, we provide links to  a case demonstrating the efficiency and usefulness of MWG.
