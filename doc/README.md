> What is MWG?

MwG is the first Many World Temporal Graph. In a nutshell, this project define a Graph storage and processing framework that allows to store complex data structures, highly connected, and highly evolving over time. Finally this data structure can be seen has infinitly clonable to test various graph modification and search for the best one. Namely speaking MwG is a the conerstone for a reasoning engine. So MwG is:

> What is a temporal graph

A temporal organize data such as a graph, therfore a set of nodes and relationships between them. A temporal graph in addition add as a first class entity the time. Therefore all nodes attributes and relationships can change overtime.

> To do what ?

In short analyzing data in motion! In many domains data coming from many devices and from various timepoints has to be aggregated in a coherent view in order to reason and take decision. Towards such goal MwG also include various machine learning algorithm to empower complex data structure directly into the temporal graph... Perfect applications for MwG are: IoT systems, Smart Grid, Trading prediction and simulation engine...

> Who are we ?

Behind MwG a group of research is hardly working to make it a reality and match close to production performance. MwG is coded in Java with a lot of attention on any method performance impact. I's proudly build from scratch without no dependency and can manage millions of nodes per secondes on a single computer...

> How to start ?

In this small documentation we provide the essential informations for a quick start. Then we provide links to case study that demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of MwG.
